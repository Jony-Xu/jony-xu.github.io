## What is Fragment Addiction?

A compulsive obsession with an activity or behavior that is so overwhelming that it disrupts one's normal routine and daily schedule.

When someone withdraws from the activity suddenly, they experience negative emotions, feelings, and even anxiety.

## How fragment Addiction Develops

1. Intrinsically

Work-related stress or feeling the need to be productive during short breaks 
leads to seeking stimulation for dopamine release in the brain.

2. External

Through algorithmic recommendations of short videos that target personal interests and preferences, 
along with incentives like cash-out bonuses.

## How to overcome

1. Recognition

Accept yourself - gaming is okay, and taking time to rest is also okay.
Don't pressure yourself to overcome the addiction immediately. Instead, analyze how much time you spend on these activities and consider if that aligns with your goals.

2. Transformation

Create daily plans. One effective method I've seen involves dividing the day into time blocks and tracking completed tasks.
Try new activities and embrace challenges - they can energize you.
Step out of your comfort zone, even if it's just one small step at a time.

- **"Disrupts"** instead of "sacrifices" - More accurate terminology for describing how addiction affects routines.

- **"Recognition"** instead of "Realize" - More formal and appropriate for the context of understanding one's condition.
